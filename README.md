This is a Next JS + Shadcn UI personalized template. Actually, I made this for myself so I don't need to waste my time to overthinking about the config and setup and focusing on the development.

But if you also find this template is useful, you also can use it. And of course I'm open to any feedbacks. You can fork or clone this repo and make a PR here if you have a some idea.
